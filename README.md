# ShipSec Studio

## About This Project

ShipSec Studio is my go-to platform for automating and orchestrating security workflows. It brings together vulnerability scanning, asset discovery, and AI-driven analysis into a single visual interface — allowing security teams to build, schedule, and monitor complex security pipelines without writing boilerplate infrastructure code. Built on top of Temporal for durable execution and Docker for isolated runtimes, it is designed to be self-hosted, extensible, and production-ready.

---

**Open-Source Security Workflow Orchestration Platform.**

> ShipSec is currently in active development. We are optimizing the platform for stable production use and high-performance security operations.

ShipSec Studio provides a visual DSL and runtime for building, executing, and monitoring automated security workflows. It decouples security logic from infrastructure management, providing a durable and isolated environment for running security tooling at scale.

### 🏗️ Core Pillars

- **Durable, resumable workflows** powered by Temporal.io for stateful execution across failures.
- **Isolated security runtimes** using ephemeral containers with per-run volume management.
- **Unified telemetry streams** delivering terminal output, events, and logs via a low-latency SSE pipeline.
- **Visual no-code builder** that compiles complex security graphs into an executable DSL.

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### 1. Shipsec Self-Host with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run ShipSec Studio on your own infrastructure:

#### One-Line Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShipSecAI/studio/main/install.sh | bash
```

This installer will:

- Check and install missing dependencies (docker, just, curl, jq, git)
- Start Docker if not running
- Clone the repository and start all services
- Guide you through any required setup steps

Once complete, visit **http://localhost:8090** to access ShipSec Studio.

### 2. ShipSec Cloud (Preview)

The fastest way to test ShipSec Studio without managing infrastructure.

- **Try it out:** [studio.shipsec.ai](https://studio.shipsec.ai)
- **Note:** ShipSec Studio is under active development. The cloud environment is a technical preview for evaluation and sandbox testing.

### 3. Self-Host (Docker)

For teams requiring data residency and air-gapped security orchestrations. This setup runs the full stack (Frontend, Backend, Worker, and Infrastructure).

**Prerequisites:**

- **[docker](https://www.docker.com/)** - For running the application and security components
- **[just](https://github.com/casey/just)** - Command runner for simplified workflows
- **curl** and **jq** - For fetching release information

```bash
# Clone and start the latest stable release
git clone https://github.com/ShipSecAI/studio.git
cd studio
just prod start-latest
```

Access the studio at `http://localhost:8090`.

- **Vulnerability**: `Nuclei`, `TruffleHog`
- **Utility**: `JSON Transform`, `Logic Scripts`, `HTTP Requests`

### Advanced Orchestration

- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Pause workflows for approvals, form inputs, or manual validation before continuing.
- **AI-Driven Analysis**: Leverage LLM nodes and MCP providers for intelligent results interpretation.
- **Native Scheduling**: Integrated CRON support for recurring security posture and compliance monitoring.
- **API First**: Trigger and monitor any workflow execution via a comprehensive REST API.

### MCP Integration

- **MCP Library**: Centralized MCP server management with multi-server selection and automatic tool registration

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

ShipSec Studio is designed for enterprise-grade durability and horizontal scalability.

- **Management Plane (Backend)**: NestJS service handling DSL compilation, secret management (AES-256-GCM), and identity.
- **Orchestration Plane (Temporal)**: Manages workflow state, concurrency, and persistent wait states.
- **Execution Plane (Worker)**: Stateless agents that pull tasks from Temporal and execute tool-bound activities in isolated runtimes.
- **Monitoring (SSE/Loki)**: Real-time telemetry pipeline for deterministic execution visibility.

Learn more about our design decisions and system components in the **[Architecture Deep-dive](/docs/architecture.mdx)**.
